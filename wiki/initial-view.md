# Initial View

The Inital view position of scenes should be configured assuming that the average user is fullscreen on a 16:9 1080p monitor. It should be set to show the entire scene. For players, if their tokens are on the scene, the view will start zoomed in and centered on their owned token. So, the initial scene view only really affects GMs.

To configure it:

1. Align the image horizontally so that it fits between the right sidebar and left toolbar.
2. Align vertically so that it fills the screen, assuming that GMs will usually toggle off the nav bar.
3. Zoom it out by 1 or 2 ticks to make it fit more within the nav bar and macro bar.
