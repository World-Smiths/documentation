# Unique Discord Invite Link

## What is this?

On the last column of the [Creators Dashboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18WjJD0-mmqIgs6Lqko40Jp22uwwaDAuHK32r_Z__KXs/edit), in the `"bugs"` field of the manifests ([world.json](https://github.com/World-Smiths/template-world/blob/main/world/world.json) and [module.json](https://github.com/World-Smiths/template-world/blob/main/world/module.json)) as well as the [README.md](https://github.com/World-Smiths/template-world/blob/main/README.md), you are instructed to insert a unique Discord invite link.
This link should be the same in all of these locations.

## How do I find the link?

You need to generate it yourself. Don't worry because this is super easy. The first step is heading over to our Discord server and switching to the [#general](https://discord.com/channels/873379131646160896/873379131646160899) channel.
