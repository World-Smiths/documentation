# World Smiths Wiki

Welcome to the World Smiths Wiki!

Here you will find a collection of world building documentation, code snippets, and examples.

## Start Here

Are you new to the project and not sure where to get started? That's fine! This section of the wiki will walk you through everything you need to configure your local workstation, interact with content, and submit changes to worlds.

Content in this section will try to be geared towards individuals with little to know technical experience, so don't stress if you're not familiar with the tools you see. However, if you would like to learn more about each individual aspect or want to know about more advanced configurations continue down to the individual category sections.
